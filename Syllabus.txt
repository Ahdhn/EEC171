Grading

Letter; based on homework (10%), projects (30%), midterms (15% each), and final (30%).

The midterms and final must be taken at the appointed time; in the event of a student emergency, midterm and final makeups will be oral. We reserve the right to regrade entire exams or homeworks in the event of a request for a regrade. Regrade requests should be in writing, and must be given to the teaching staff within one week of the time the assignment/exam was returned to you.

Late policy (projects only): -20%/day late, weekends count as one day.

Grades are earned, not awarded or negotiated, and to the best of my ability, I will give you the grade that you earn. The grade you earn is indicated by the grades you receive on exams, homeworks, and projects. If you feel it is indicated by something other than exams, homeworks, and projects, and you want to know my views on this topic, please read Making the Grade (Links to an external site.) by Georgia Tech Professor Kurt Wiesenfeld.
